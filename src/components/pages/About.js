      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am an innovative young software engineer with a background in astrophysics and full-stack coding. I got my bachelor's degree from Pomona College  and worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for one year before deciding to switch to web coding.
        I did a 3-month intensive course through the University of Pennsylvania to brush off my skills, and I'm now seeking employment as a full-stack developer. 
        In my free time, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and going to live performance. Talk to me about dance, musicals, or live music if you want an earful!
